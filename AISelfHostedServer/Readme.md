Self-hosted AI refers to artificial intelligence (AI) systems that are deployed and run on an organization's or individual's own hardware infrastructure rather than relying on cloud-based services or external platforms. This means that the AI algorithms, models, and data processing tasks are executed locally, within the premises or under the direct control of the user.

Self-hosted AI offers several advantages:

    Data Privacy and Security: By keeping data on-premises, organizations can maintain greater control over sensitive data, reducing the risk of data breaches or unauthorized access.

    Customization and Control: Users have more flexibility to customize AI models and algorithms to meet their specific requirements. They can also control the entire AI pipeline, from data preprocessing to model training and deployment.

    Performance: Self-hosted AI systems can offer better performance for latency-sensitive applications by reducing network overhead and processing data locally.

    Compliance: Certain industries, such as healthcare and finance, have strict regulatory requirements regarding data privacy and security. Self-hosted AI allows organizations to ensure compliance with these regulations by keeping data within their own infrastructure.

However, self-hosted AI also comes with challenges, such as the need for substantial computational resources, expertise in deploying and managing AI infrastructure, and potential limitations in scalability compared to cloud-based solutions.

We are going to Install it. And help you with step by step guide.

### Guide and Instructions.

1. Choose a Virtual Machine Platform: Select a virtualization platform such as VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, or others, and install it on your host machine.

    I personally going to use VirtualBox you can get it here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

2. Create a Virtual Machine: Use your virtualization software to create a new virtual machine. Specify the desired resources such as CPU cores, RAM, and disk space based on the requirements of your AI workload.

    I personally going to max out all the resources for test purposes.

3. Install Operating System: Install a supported operating system on the virtual machine. Popular choices for AI workloads include Ubuntu Linux, CentOS, or Debian. Make sure to keep the operating system updated with the latest security patches.

    I am going to use Ubuntu Server which you can download here: https://ubuntu.com/download/server#manual-install

## Installing Ubuntu server to VM

    Create a New Virtual Machine:
Open VirtualBox and click on the "New" button in the toolbar to create a new virtual machine. Follow the wizard to set up the VM:

    Give your VM a name (e.g., "Ubuntu Server").
    Choose the type and version of the operating system (e.g., Linux and Ubuntu 64-bit).
    Allocate memory (RAM) to the VM. Ubuntu Server typically runs well with 1-2 GB of RAM, but adjust according to your needs.
    Create a virtual hard disk (VHD) for the VM. You can choose the default options for disk type and storage allocation.

Configure VM Settings:
After creating the VM, select it from the VirtualBox Manager window and click on "Settings." Here you can configure additional settings:

    In the "System" tab, adjust boot order if necessary.
    In the "Storage" tab, attach the Ubuntu Server ISO file you downloaded in step 1 to the VM's virtual optical drive.
    Optionally, you can adjust other settings such as network, display, and shared folders according to your requirements.

Start the VM:
With the ISO attached and settings configured, start the VM by selecting it from the VirtualBox Manager and clicking the "Start" button.

Install Ubuntu Server:
The VM will boot from the Ubuntu Server ISO. Follow the on-screen prompts to install Ubuntu Server:

    Choose the language and press Enter to continue.
    Select " Keyboard Configuration " and press Done.
    Choose the type of installation we are going to select "(X) Ubuntu Server" and press Enter. (Third Party Drives are optional).
    When prompted, partition the disk (you can choose the default guided partitioning).
    Network Configuration can stay by default press Enter.
    Proxy config can stay by default press Enter.
    Wait for Ubuntu Mirrors being configureded if stuck just press Enter.
    Untick LVM group config as we dont need hover to Done and press Enter.
    Check everything to your licking and press Enter.
    Confirm Destructive action and press Enter.
    Create a user account and set up a password.
    Wait for the installation to complete.

Reboot:
Once the installation is finished, the VM will prompt you to remove the installation media and reboot. Press Enter to restart the VM.

Log In:
After rebooting, Ubuntu Server will start up. Log in with the username and password you created during installation.

Post-Installation Configuration:
After logging in, you may want to perform additional configuration tasks such as updating packages (sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade) or installing additional software.

That's it! You've successfully installed Ubuntu Server into a virtual machine. You can now use it for various purposes such as hosting web services, running applications, or setting up your self-hosted AI environment which what we are going to do next.

## Installing AI

4. Install Dependencies: Install any necessary dependencies for your AI framework or tools. This may include libraries such as CUDA for GPU acceleration, Python, and other software packages required by your chosen AI framework.







    5. Install AI Framework: Install the AI framework of your choice. Common choices include TensorFlow, PyTorch, Apache MXNet, or others. Refer to the official documentation of the framework for installation instructions specific to your operating system.

    6. Configure Environment: Set up your environment variables, paths, and any other configuration settings required by your AI framework. This may involve editing configuration files or setting environment variables in your shell profile.

    Download Pre-trained Models (Optional): If you plan to use pre-trained models, download them and place them in the appropriate directories. Some AI frameworks provide tools or commands to download and install pre-trained models automatically.

    Test Installation: Verify that your AI framework is installed correctly by running some sample scripts or commands provided in the documentation. This will ensure that your environment is set up properly and ready for further development or deployment.

    Additional Setup (Optional): Depending on your specific requirements, you may need to perform additional setup steps such as configuring network settings, setting up data storage, or installing additional software packages.

    Backup and Maintenance: Once your self-hosted AI environment is set up, make sure to regularly back up your virtual machine and perform maintenance tasks such as installing updates and monitoring system performance.

Remember that this is a general guide, and the exact steps may vary depending on your specific requirements and the AI framework you choose to install. Always refer to the official documentation of the software you are installing for the most up-to-date instructions.
